/*
 * Styling workarounds for Windows.
 *
 * The issue: shadows defined by LibAdwaita are very wide: up to 60px.
 * The shadow is drawn inside the (clickable) window.
 *
 * These styles change the (window) background to be a lot more compact.
 * This results in a smaller shadow around the window, and as such a
 * smaller click surface for the whole window, making it feel less awkward
 * when you click just outside the window.
